Image classification of various mushroom species

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT AN EXPERT AND THIS IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL TOOL FOR IDENTIFICATION AND YOU SHOULD NEVER CONSUME ANYTHING WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE ID! THIS IS A PASSION PROJECT FOR CODING AND PERSONAL INTEREST IN MUSHROOMS, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE THIS APP FOR A RELIABLE ID!

Please consider other sources such as the mushroomID subreddit where you can get various input and responses.

Project is a WIP of a image identification mobile app for mushrooms various species, will feature descriptions and different information regarding the mushroom, such as identification methods, uses, and history.

Maybe more features as I work on it, as of right now this is what I have. 

Intentions as of 12/2023: Swift mobile application that will utilize the camera and work with a dataset to attempt to identify mushroom species from various angles based on their features.

Currently using: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy
